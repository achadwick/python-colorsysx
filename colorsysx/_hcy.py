"""HCY colour model.

HCY is a tractable hue, chroma and lightness colour space based on the
work of Kuzma Shapran. HCY uses a luma term (Y) to define how bright a
colour is, a Hue term that defines where on the colour wheel it sits,
and a relative Chroma term that descibes how colourful it is.

It's very like HSLuv, but its luma term is the same as the equivalent
YUV model's.

HCY can be thought of as a cylindrical expansion of the YUV/YPbPr solid:
the "C" term is the proportion of the maximum permissible chroma within
the RGB gamut at a given hue and luma. Planes of constant Y are
equiluminant.

It's also a special case of the GHLS colour model, with the right
weighting parameters.

Different weights can be provided for R, G, and B when converting to and
from HCY. The defaults make manipulating colours to meet WCAG 2.2 or
draft 3.0 contrast criteria easier. You should use appropriately gamma
corrected R'G'B' values before converting to HCY['], if you're doing this.
