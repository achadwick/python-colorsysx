# colorsysX

🎨👁️ _Extra, human-relevant, colour spaces derived from RGB_

This package extends the standard Python library's `colorsys` module
with a few additional, useful, colour spaces. The models of colour
provided here are simple, but relevant to human vision and the perceived
lightness of different colour hues.

## Colour models

* **YUV** (specifically, YPbPr): a luma and colour difference model.
* **HCY**: a cylindrical hue, relative chroma, and luma model.
* **GLHS**: a _generalized_ lightness/hue/saturation model.

[YUV][1] has a perceptually relevant lightness term. It can preserve
absolute chroma when manipulating luma.

[HCY][2] is intuitive to use, and its lightness term is the same as
YUV's. It's particularly useful when manipulating colours to meet WCAG
2.2 or draft 3.0 WCAG contrast criteria.

[GLHS][3] is a generalization of the cylindrical coordinate spaces
provided in `colorsysx` and `colorsys`. It can be parameterised to
provide any of the other similar models.

# For developers

ColorsysX is library code, with no bundled scripts. Other projects are
free to depend on it in the normal way.

## Installation

To install the [latest version from PyPI][4], for example into your
current Python virtual environment:

```sh
pip install colorsysx
```

## Interface conventions

```python
from colorsysx import rgb_to_hcy, hcy_to_rgb

h, c, y = rgb_to_hcy(0.5, 0.7, 0.93)
r, g, b = hcy_to_rgb(h, c, y)
```

The conversion functions are named like the builtin `colorsys` module's
functions, and share a very similar interface. For each colour system
ABC, this package provides two functions:

    rgb_to_abc() → a, b, c
    abc_to_rgb() → r, g, b

All inputs and outputs are tuples of 3 floats in the range [0.0, 1.0].
Unlike `colorsysx`, the functions accept optional weighting parameters,
which can be used to tune the colour model being used.

## Testing and developing

ColorsysX is developed on GitHub as [achadwick/python-colorsysx][5].
Please report bugs via the [issue tracker][6] there.

ColorsysX uses [tox][7] to run tests and manage utility Python
environments. Examples:

```sh
# Run all standard tests in parallel on all available Pythons
tox -p

# Run the system version of Python interactively in a venv with
# colorsysx available.
tox -e py python
```

The build system is [flit][8], and the project is PEP 621 and PEP 517
compliant.
